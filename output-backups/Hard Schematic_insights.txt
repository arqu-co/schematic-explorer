Summary: The extraction is mostly accurate, with a few minor discrepancies in carrier assignments within a single layer and a slight over-extraction of entries. The core data points like limits, participations, and premiums are generally correct.

ISSUES FOUND:
----------------------------------------
1. Layer $100M: Multiple carriers (Partner Re Insurance Solutions of Bermuda Ltd., Superior Specialty Ins. Co., Western World Ins. Co., Palomar Excess & Surplus Ins. Co., Dellwood Specialty Ins. Co., Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's) are listed under cell E26, but only one carrier should be assigned per cell. The extracted data lists them all as separate entries with the same participation and premium, which is likely an over-extraction or misinterpretation of how the data is presented in the Excel sheet.
2. Layer $50M: The carrier 'United Specialty Insurance Co.' is listed with a participation of 0.05 and premium of 2500000.0, and 'Lloyd's of London' is listed with the same values. These appear to be separate entries in the Excel sheet (F39), but the extracted data lists them as distinct entries with identical values, which might be an over-extraction.
3. Layer $25M: The carrier 'AmWins ATL' is listed with a participation of 0.1 and premium of 2500000.0. This entry appears to be a standalone entry in cell B64, which is outside the typical carrier rows for this layer, suggesting a potential misassignment or over-extraction.
4. The total number of extracted entries is 52, which seems to be slightly higher than the distinct carrier entries visible in the provided Excel data, indicating a potential for over-extraction in some areas.

SUGGESTIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. Review the extraction logic for cells containing multiple carrier names to ensure each carrier is correctly assigned to its respective layer and participation.
2. Investigate the handling of standalone entries like 'AmWins ATL' in cell B64 to prevent misassignment or over-extraction.
3. Refine the extraction process to accurately count distinct carrier entries and avoid over-extraction, especially in rows with multiple carriers listed in a single cell.
