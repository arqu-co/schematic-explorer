Summary: The extraction correctly identified all insurance layers and the policies within them. However, it failed to extract participation and premium values, and did not fully parse the 'xs.' notation for excess layers.

ISSUES FOUND:
----------------------------------------
1. Participation and premium values were not extracted for any of the entries.
2. The 'xs.' notation in 'Umbrella $50M xs. $50M' and 'General Liability $40M xs. $10M' was not fully parsed or represented in the extracted data.

SUGGESTIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. Implement logic to extract participation and premium values from the source data.
2. Enhance parsing capabilities to correctly interpret and represent 'xs.' notation for excess layers.
