Verification Insights: Sample Tower BC.xlsx
============================================================

Score: 95%
Summary: The initial extraction achieved a high accuracy of 95%. The primary issues identified were discrepancies in premium values for several carriers within the $10M layer. All other data points, including participation percentages and layer descriptions, were extracted correctly. Cross-validation confirmed these premium discrepancies.

ISSUES FOUND:
----------------------------------------
1. Premium for AWAC Bermuda in the $10M layer is extracted as 700000.0 but should be 3500000.0 based on the Excel data.
2. Premium for RSUI in the $10M layer is extracted as 850000.0 but should be 3400000.0 based on the Excel data.
3. Premium for GenStar in the $10M layer is extracted as 390000.0 but should be 3250000.0 based on the Excel data.
4. Premium for Lloyd's (IGO) in the $10M layer is extracted as 256000.0 but should be 3200000.0 based on the Excel data.

SUGGESTIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. Review the logic for extracting premium values, particularly for the $10M layer, to ensure accurate mapping from the Excel sheet.
2. Implement more robust checks for premium calculations, considering potential variations in how premiums are represented across different layers and carriers.
