Score: 95%
Summary: The initial extraction was largely accurate, with the primary issues concentrated in the premium values for several carriers within the $10M layer. All other data points, including participation percentages and layer descriptions, were correctly identified. The cross-validation confirmed these premium discrepancies.

ISSUES FOUND:
----------------------------------------
1. Premium for Lloyd's (IGO) in the $10M layer is extracted as 256000.0, but the Excel source shows 3200000.
2. Premium for GenStar in the $10M layer is extracted as 390000.0, but the Excel source shows 3250000.
3. Premium for RSUI in the $10M layer is extracted as 850000.0, but the Excel source shows 3400000.
4. Premium for AWAC Bermuda in the $10M layer is extracted as 700000.0, but the Excel source shows 3500000.

SUGGESTIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. Review the logic for extracting premium values, particularly for entries within the $10M layer, to ensure accurate mapping from the source data.
2. Double-check the row and column alignment during extraction to prevent misinterpretation of values across different carriers or layers.
