A few minor discrepancies were noted in the 'Layer $10M' section regarding the premium for Kemah/National Fire & Marine. (1 false positives filtered)

ISSUES FOUND:
----------------------------------------
1. Layer $10M: Kemah/National Fire & Marine [cell:E116] has a premium of 375000.0 in the extracted data, but the Excel source shows 387000.0 in cell K118.

SUGGESTIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. Ensure that when verifying premiums, the correct column in the Excel sheet is referenced, especially when multiple columns contain financial data.
2. Double-check the row number for premium values, as the participation row (e.g., B118) and the premium row (e.g., K118) can be adjacent but distinct.
