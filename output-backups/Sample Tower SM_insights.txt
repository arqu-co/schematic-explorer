Verification Insights: Sample Tower SM.xlsx
============================================================

Score: 95%
Summary: The cross-validation revealed that most of the data was extracted accurately. The primary issues were related to carrier misassignments within specific layers, particularly in the $100M and $50M layers, where multiple carriers were incorrectly grouped under a single cell reference. Several minor numerical discrepancies in participation values were also noted but are considered negligible due to value equivalence rules. The overall structure and most data points are correct. (16 false positives filtered)

ISSUES FOUND:
----------------------------------------
1. In the $100M layer, 'Superior Specialty Ins. Co.', 'Western World Ins. Co.', 'Palomar Excess & Surplus Ins. Co.', and 'Dellwood Specialty Ins. Co.' were incorrectly grouped under cell E26. The Excel data shows these carriers in separate columns (E, F, G, H respectively).
2. In the $100M layer, 'Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's' was incorrectly grouped under cell E26. The Excel data shows this carrier in column I.
3. In the $50M layer, 'Specialty Builders Insurance Co.', 'United Specialty Insurance Co.', 'Lloyd's of London', 'Velocity Specialty Insurance Co.', 'National Fire & Marine Ins. Co.', 'Fortegra Specialty Ins. Co,', and 'Emerald Bay Specialty Ins. Co.' were incorrectly grouped under cell F39. The Excel data shows these carriers in separate columns (E, F, G, H, I, J, K respectively).

SUGGESTIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. Improve the logic for parsing carrier names that appear in cells with multiple entries. Ensure that each carrier is correctly mapped to its corresponding column and % SHARE row.
2. Refine the carrier identification process to better distinguish between carriers listed in the same cell but belonging to different columns.
3. Review the handling of complex cell entries containing multiple carrier names and their associated percentages to ensure accurate assignment.
